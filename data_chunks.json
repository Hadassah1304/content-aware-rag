Typically, short absences for exams or school-related commitments may be accommodated if requested in advance and coordinated with the team.\n- Q: Can I be eligible for conversion to a full-time role while still interning?\n  A: Many interns convert to full-time roles if they perform well; hiring managers will evaluate conversion opportunities and make recommendations in alignment with People & Culture processes.\n- Q: Can I come in late or leave early occasionally?\n  A: Managers are expected to be flexible for legitimate reasons; however, regular attendance during core hours is required to ensure mentorship, training, and participation in team activities.",
